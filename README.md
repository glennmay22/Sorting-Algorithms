<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project implements multiple classic sorting algorithms in Python, including
selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, and a hybrid merge–insertion
sort. Each algorithm supports custom comparator functions and optional ascending or
descending ordering.

The goal of this project was to strengthen understanding of algorithmic design,
time and space complexity, recursion, and practical tradeoffs between different
sorting techniques.
